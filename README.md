the __HTML Turing Machine Language (HTML)__ is a programming language embedded in HTML.

This is the reference implementation of HTML.

* The output of every HTML program is HTML.
* A _div_ is an HTML function definition.
* A _link_ is an HTML function call. You may navigate to a function's definition by clicking it's call.
* A special link called _eval_ will bring you forward one step in the computation. 
* To step forwards and backwards in the computation, hit your Forward or Back button.
* You will be redirected to the current page if you eval HTML with erroneous syntax.
