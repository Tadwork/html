the HTML Turing Machine Language (HTML) is a programming language embedded in HTML.

This is the reference implementation of HTML.

All inputs to this implementation of HTML are HTML.
All outputs this implementation of HTML are HTML.

<a href><a> is an HTML function call. You can find where any function is defined by clicking the link.
  
This language provides two special links:

the "eval" link. This brings you one step forward in the computation, analogous to "Forward".

The "lave" link. This brings you one step backward in the computation, analogous to "Back".
